This web app was developed in vue.js for a quick implementation.

This web app have three views.

The Landing Page -> to inform the user about the web app.
The Dashboard -> is where all the recipes are, the user can search by recipe title or filter to get the recipe 
The 404 Page -> is to inform the user that the url cannot be reached

The recipes and the ingredients data are on .JSON file to replicate a get request, in order that the aplication can work if there are more data.

The design was inspired by the Graphite Web Page using the logo, font, and some styles to follow the visual guidlines

To run the application in local, you have to clone the repo and run: "npm run dev"
